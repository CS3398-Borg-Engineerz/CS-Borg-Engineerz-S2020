# CS-Borg-Engineerz-S2020

Chance Martin, Ola Nzeogu, Bailey Cheung, and Josh Armstrong, are creating a web application that will help Texas State students find organizations and clubs based on their interests. 

Our goal is to create a tool where students can enter what they are most interested in and after their data is processed they will be presented with what clubs will match them the best.

This team is working together to build a platform for clubs so that students can find organizations that spark new and old interests and help them find organizations they want to be a part of.
