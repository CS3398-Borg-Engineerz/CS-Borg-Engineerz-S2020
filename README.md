### **Team Goal**
Our goal is to create a web application that will help Texas State students find organizations and clubs based on their interests. This team is working together to build a platform for clubs so that students can find organizations that spark new and old interests and help them find organizations they want to be a part of.

### **General Info**
Our Web Applicaiton will allow students to filter through organizations of interest, learn about the organizaiton's meeting times, upcoming events and purpose, as well as suggest additional organizations that the user may be interested in. This appliction will extract the information from our Database, which we have created based on the current clubs and organizations at Texas State University. Additional features of the Application will be discussed below.

### **Web Application Core Functionalities**
* Search bar that looks up an organization from our DB based on the name typed into the search field
* Organization home page with all relevant information, ie meeting times, upcoming events, organization leader's contact information, social media links.  
* Organizations will be tagged with attributes based on what their organization does. CS clubs have CS tags, Math club have math tags, freshman friendly tags, etc 
* Organization meeting times and events will be populated into a calendar, and after clicking the event, relevant details will pop up 
*


### **Web Application Additonal Features**
* Check list of interests that the student can check that correlate to different organizations 
* Suggestions of similar clubs based on the organization that you search
* Organizations will be able to edit their information and tags.
